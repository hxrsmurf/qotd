I wrote a bit of a script to grab a random quote from my local MySQL database and e-mail it to a few friends of mine. I'd like to write a Facebook extension for it, but I could never figure out how to do that.

If the quote is more than 140 characters, I trim it and add elipses, because of the text message. It mostly works. I have it sent off via CRON too.
